            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I am an aspiring web developer with a passion for technology and creativity. 
                I enjoy solving puzzles, listening music, and playing football. 
                My goal is to combine design and logic to build useful applications for the web.

            <h2>Why do I want to learn HTML?</h2>
            <p>
                First and foremost, I want to learn HTML because it is the foundational building block of the internet. 
                Every website I visit, from social media platforms to news outlets, is structured using HTML. 
                Understanding this language gives me the power to look "under the hood" of the web and understand 
                how digital content is organized and displayed to the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, learning HTML is the first step toward a career in web development. By mastering 
                the structure of web pages, I create a solid base upon which I can layer CSS for styling 
                and JavaScript for interactivity. It is a necessary skill for anyone looking to work in tech, 
                marketing, or digital design, allowing me to bring my own creative ideas to life in a browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, I believe that coding is a form of modern literacy. Even if I don't become a 
                full-time software engineer, knowing HTML allows me to communicate better in a digital world. 
                It empowers me to build my own personal portfolio, customize blogs, and create content that 
                is accessible to everyone, giving me a voice on the global stage.
